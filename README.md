Code for implementing Synaptic-RA model, demonstrating how the model evolves to form an attractor manifold (equilibrium point, travelling wave solution) under two types of inputs (endogenous and exogenous inputs).
Environmental requirements: Python 3.8.10
Install dependencies: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
Two folders: Synaptic-RA is for information integration, Synaptic-RA2 is for information tracking.
